          <h1>Skills Certification</h1>
          <p>certifications can enhance your marketability in the field, as many employers view certs as tangible proof of your aptitude in specific areas of programming or development, says John Reed, senior executive director at Robert Half Technology, a staffing firm that focuses on filling jobs in IT.
              <br><br>
            Most certification programs are conducted and proctored online, with certifying groups testing your knowledge in the field at large, as well as your specific expertise and problem solving for the particular certification area.

          <h1>Bootcamp</h1>
            <p>The goal of many coding bootcamp is to transition into a career in web development. They do this by learning to build applications at a professional level, providing the foundation they need to build applications, and demonstrate they have the skills to add real value to a potential employer. Attending a coding bootcamp is a viable alternative to graduating with a 4 year degree in Computer Science.
                <br><br>
            Coding bootcamps focus on high-impact learning and teach only the skills that will prove to be most relevant in the real-world. These programs focus is to skill create developers with exactly what they will need to be successful coding in the professional world.

            The time frame that members attend a coding bootcamp is  short when compared to training with a four-year degree from university. In order to make this work, all non-essential skills are ruthlessly cut from the coding bootcamp curriculum.
                <br><br>
            Coding bootcamps are ideal for people who want to obtain the technical skills that will help them become employable , but to also do so in a very short time frame.

            Bootcamps focus on providing an accelerated rate of high-impact learning, and are not for everyone. These programs are designed specifically for people who want to maximize the amount of skills they obtain during an intense training experience.

          <h1>Debugging</h1>
            <p>There are several tools used to debug a program. This is an area I still struggle with, as I usually have others look at my code to review. Let me take this time to show you the different methods I have used in debug this very site</p>
        
            <div>
                <h2>Tracing</h2>
                    <p>In tracing, we examin individual statements that are being executed in the program. There are two ways we can do this: </p>
            </div>
                    
                        <h4>windows.alert()</h4>
                            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ne brute dicat ius, at detraxit reprimique percipitur mel, eum quaeque petentium disputationi in. Id ubique tractatos facilisis sed. Bonorum salutatus an nec, ex dolores phaedrum salutatus sea, pro enim novum electram et. Usu fabulas oportere maiestatis cu, ipsum cetero repudiandae vis ei, percipit sensibus eos ne.</p>
                        <h4>console.log()</h4>
                            <p>Ex consulatu intellegebat cum. Everti platonem vim ne, vis pericula iudicabit ea. Mel prima repudiare an, pri justo illum an. Virtute consequuntur ex vim, tractatos persequeris mea at.</p>

                    <h2> Commenting Out</h2>
                        <p>This method is the easiest to impliment; Basicaly, you enclose the code that you suspect is broken in a comment.I personally use this often if I don't want to erase old code.</p>

                    <h2> Break methods</h2>
                            <h4>Break Mode</h4>
                                <p>Break mode refers to the temporary suspension of program execution so that you can monitor values and trace program execution.</p>
                            <h4>Breakpoints</h4>
                                <p>A breakpoint is a statement in the code at which program execution enters break mode.</p>
                            <h4>Bulletproofing</h4>
                                 <p>Writing code that anticipates and handles potential problems is often called bulletproofing. </p>                    <br>
