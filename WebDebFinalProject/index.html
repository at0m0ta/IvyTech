                <h2>Reasons for working with Code</h2>
                    <p>You work for yourself and have the ability to create your own schedule. The pay is higher than most careers in this day and age. Many developers with more experience can easily charge over $100 an hour for freelance or contract work.
                        <br><br>
                        Developers and software engineers are so bombarded with work requests that they end up specifying that they are not looking for any new opportunities; That being said, we are able to work fewer hours a week. This means we have the opportunity to spend more time on hobbies, travel, and family time.</p>

               <h2>"How do I know I should become a developer?"</h2> 
                   <p>Before you get started, I need to warn you that programming is not for everyone.
                    <br><br>
                    It requires dedication to your work. The “learning list” always keeps getting bigger instead of the smaller. You are either a forever student, or you should be considering something else, because you will be left behind when it comes to developing your skills.
                       <br><br>
                    It’s challenging and a lot of people get burned out working as a developer. You’ll be dealing with long hours of “mentally exhausting” work, tight deadlines, nearly impossible legacy code, inconsistent and ambitious requirements, and sometimes sub-par work environments.
                       <br><br>
                    Programming requires analytical thinking, good decision making, patience and  a lot of curiosity.
                    Sometimes it even requires you to be self-taught. You can learn the theory from the books, but when your code breaks, nobody is going to come fix it for you.</p>
