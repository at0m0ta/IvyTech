        <h2>Building your presence as a developer</h2>
              <p>An online presence is a virtual representation of you, with the ability to offer information and engage with others in the online world.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                It usually starts with at least one of the following: a YouTube Channel, a GitHub, a blog, subreddits (or other forms on your niche), or any of the social media sites (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn).On these sites, you create a professional profile that outlines who you are and your area of expertise. Then you engage with that community by posting either content you’ve created, links to and comments on content you find interesting or provoking, and conversation with others on the platform.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                When you have been posting about a certain topic for a while, displaying and sharing your knowledge, other people in your specific domain and niche will find you and read your information. As time goes on, these people will start to interact with you on the internet.
                  <br>
                  <br>

                As you continue to provide them value through the various videos, blog posts, or social media shares, you are building relationships with the people who follow you. This engagement allows you to build a network in your field through the internet.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                Why is having a large network even useful? For meeting new people, finding new people to work with on cool side projects or business ideas, finding people that are interested in the same topics as you, and much more.</p>
           
       <br>
       <br>
      
          <h3>Portfolio</h3>
           <p>A portfolio is not a resume. A portfolio is a way to backup all of the skills you’ve listed in your resume – and it is essentially a showcase of your work. It is your platform to “show, not tell” potential employers and clients about the work you can do. Your portfolio is also your opportunity to create and define your brand as a technology professional. Your brand is a very important aspect of your identity as a developer because your brand will be what gets employers excited about YOU.
               <br>
               <br>
            Most importantly, your portfolio should express your style and personality as a developer. Once again, portfolios are all about demonstrating your technical skills, and creativity as a developer.</p>

          <h3>Resume</h3>
           <p>Each advertised job will typically attract hundreds of applications. It takes a lot of time and effort to read all these applications and unfortunately the majority of them are pretty poor. They are poor because information is missing, or the experience described is too general. All the information should be presented on a platter for the hiring manager. It should be detailed and easy to find. If somebody has to call you or email you to get clarity on something, you are putting an obstacle in their way.
               <br>
               <br>
            You are a developer and the main showcase of your talents is the code you write. Make sure that you add links to your coding accounts. If you don’t have any, you should create them and keep them updated.
               <br>
               <br>
            If you have a stack overflow account then list it. If you contribute to open source projects, add them. If you have an online presence that in any way supports the role you are applying for, make sure it’s listed.

            If you haven’t listed any accounts showcasing your talents, you are making it harder for the hiring manager. They want to see some code before we invest time in interviewing you.</p>
          <h3>Social Media</h3>
           <p> Social media marketing includes a myriad of potential social media sites, a vast array of ways to engage, and a medley of styles for each platform. It’s more than just Facebook. You need to figure out which of the legion networks to join. Then, you need to determine optimal messages, posting frequency, cost of social media management, integration with other marketing channels, and how to make the most of the billions of people who are purportedly hanging out on social media.</p>
