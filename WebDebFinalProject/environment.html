			<h2>"Where should I work?"</h2>
                <p>Being a software developer often involves spending hours sitting at a desk staring at a computer, so it is important to have the right ergonomics. A good desk and chair, the proper lighting, and the right computer equipment go a long way towards increasing productivity throughout the day. 
                    <br><br>
                Developers, on the other hand, need extra horsepower. Hard drives get filled with all sorts of things, and CPUs and memory get pushed hard while working on big projects, especially during testing and compiling. And screen space is at a premium; the more monitors you can put on a desk, the better. You will also possibly need a KVM and additional computers and devices (Macs in a Windows organization, various smartphones and tablets, etc.) for testing purposes.
                    
                <br><br>
                As a developer, you have options on where to work, but these are some of the basic things you will need to make your workplace work!</p>

			<h1>Working on-site</h1>
                <p>Working on-site within an office setting is not always common in programming, though you maybe faced with this option especially in non-tech organizations. The office layout largely depends on the orginasation. Some companies will provide you with a private office where you can concentrate on code, while others will provide you with a more socially centered open office environment. Usually, these places will have open floor cubicals in which you will share the space with other collegues.<p>
            
                <h3>Tech Companies</h3>
                    <p>Tech companies like Microsoft, Apple, SalesForce, Oracle, are the first we think of where we can find tech jobs.
                        <br><br>
                    Emphasis on getting things done without sacrificing quality. Co-workers are more likely to keep up to date with technology (whether or not they can utilize it at work) and often look how they can integrate new ideas or frameworks into the daily routine to make the software better.
                    <br><br>
                    You maybe able to get more help and tips from fellow developers. Being around other developers means you will have more thiings in common that working with non-tech focused employees, it's a different culture. The main benifit of working within a tech-centered organization, is that the focus is to expand your education towards tech development. Retaining employees and developing their knowledge is the main focus of tech industries, which means you will keep learning as long as you want! </p>
                <h3>Other Industry</h3>
                    <p>However, you must realize that technology can be found in any and all places of business. Companies like Eli Lily, Cummins Inc., university hospitals and others have integrated tech departments into their  business.
                        <br><br>
                     That being said, the experience of working in a non-tech related company is vastly different from working within a tech centered organization. Most of the time, you will be made the lead expert in software or IT faster. That may sound appealing, but most of the time that also means you will not have anyone else helping you develop programms or create projects with. This environment can be highly stressful, but also highly rewarding.<p>
       <br>
       <br>
			<h1>Working Remote</h1>
                <p>When working from home, you need to create the segregation that usually exists when you get into the office. When you’re at your desk, you’re working (hopefully), but the whole concept can go out with the bathwater when you’re at home all day. This is where a routine can come in handy.
                    <br><br>
                Because you need to be available and reliably so during business hours, it’s important that you know all the collaboration tools out there to make it possible. You’re not supposed to be online from the crack of dawn until bedtime, so make those eight hours a day count.There are a variety of programs and apps for making communication as a remote worker easy and effective – make sure everyone you need to be in touch with is plugged in
                <br><br>
                If you’re going to make the transition from office to home office, then the importance of having a proper workspace cannot be stressed enough. Working on the couch isn’t going to cut it here, love – a dedicated space that allows for uninterrupted work is key.</p>
            
            <h3>Independant / Freelance</h3>
                <p>Freelancing also provides the benefit of allowing you to basically work whenever you want. You will still have some meetings to coordinate during normal working hours, and you'll need to be available on Slack and by email. However, this is only going to account for a small number of hours and you can create your own schedule. Do you work better late at night than during the day? Feel free to spend all day sleeping and work when you feel most productive. 
                    <br><br>
                    if you get bored easily, then the ability to work on multiple projects at the same time is great for keeping you motivated and engaged. If you are getting bored with a particular technology, you can seek out and take on projects that will allow you to use and/or learn a new skill-set. Don't like working with a certain client? You can  commit only a few weeks of work at a time, and can easily discontinue contracts and look for a job with someone you get along with better. You  can scale back your freelance commitments when you feel like freeing up your time. And when you're running low on funds, you can scale back up.
